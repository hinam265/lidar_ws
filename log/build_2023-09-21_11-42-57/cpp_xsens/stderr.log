[33mCMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findxdpchandler.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "xdpchandler", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "xdpchandler" with
  any of the following names:

    xdpchandlerConfig.cmake
    xdpchandler-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "xdpchandler" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "xdpchandler_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "xdpchandler" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
